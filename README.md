# shruti-synthesizer
documentation for ongoing project - sound synthesis of microtonal scale

This is a related project to the Raga tuner, which arose from my personal interests and a desire to learn more in the realm of coding, software and hardware which isn't in the direct mechanical engineering curriculum. As my skills increase and the calculations and coding are completed, I will switch from doing this in a scripted language like Matlab to looking at implementation at lower level languages like C or C++, or implementing in hardware like building a microprocessor-powered PCB.

First, though, I want to get something, anything working. I am a student of Indian classical music and wanted to find a way to practice signal processing by taking in a tone from an existing instrument - a harmonium - and using its waveform as a basis for a synthesizer which does not use the equal-tempered scale but rather the microtonal shruti system of Hindustani music.
